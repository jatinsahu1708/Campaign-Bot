# 📣 Multi-Agent Chatbot for Campaign Design

A smart, modular chatbot that helps create effective marketing campaigns using **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and Generative AI.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project builds a **multi-agent chatbot** that simulates a team of experts collaborating to generate creative, data-driven marketing strategies for a product or brand. Each AI agent is responsible for a specific role in the campaign design process. The system leverages **LangGraph** to control the flow between agents and **LangChain** for handling interactions with language models. Additionally, real-world data is fetched using **TavilySearch** with **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** techniques to enhance response accuracy.

  - Brand Manager

- **🧽 LangChain + LangGraph Integration**\
  LangGraph defines how agents interact, while LangChain connects to the LLM.

- **🌐 Web Search Tool**\
  The Data Analyst uses TavilySearch to pull live stats, news, and trends.

- **📚 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**\
  Incorporates retrieved data directly into responses for better factual accuracy.

- **⚙️ Modular Design**\
  Easily extendable with more agents or features.

- **🗅️ Streamlit-Based UI**\
  Simple and clean frontend to interact with the chatbot.

## 🧱 Architecture

Each agent takes a turn in the conversation flow, building upon the previous agent's input:

```text
User Input ➞ Content Writer ➞ Graphic Designer ➞ Data Analyst ➞ Brand Manager ➞ Final Campaign Output
```

### 🧑‍🎼 Agents

| Agent            | Role                                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content Writer   | Creates slogans, taglines, ad copies                                 |
| Graphic Designer | Recommends themes, layouts, visual ideas                             |
| Data Analyst     | Fetches supporting data using TavilySearch                           |
| Brand Manager    | Aligns responses, ensures brand consistency, resolves contradictions |

Control flow is managed using **LangGraph**, allowing each agent to act sequentially until the **final campaign proposal** is ready.
